      "The final strategic target aims to reduce CO2e emissions. Sustainability and ESG are integrated aspects of Tryg's business. Tryg is dedicated to helping its customers adapt to climate change and prevent claims from happening in the first place. To achieve this, Tryg has set a target of adapting 30 product categories, corresponding to 60% of categories in scope for the EU Taxonomy. At the same time, Tryg aims to mitigate its climate impact as much as possible by reducing its own CO2e emissions. Tryg's main emission footprint is through its claims handling activities. To address this, Tryg has set a target of reducing CO2e emissions by 6% per average claim by 2027 compared to 2024.\n",

The match portfolio is primarily made up of Scandinavian covered bonds (rated AAA) matching the insurance liabilities.

      "Insurance revenue amounted to DKK 2,908m (DKK 3,502m), corresponding to a top-line decline of 16.7% (2.3%) measured in local currencies. A few relatively large customers accounted for more than half of the decline. In general, approximately 80% of the top-line decline relates to higher churn in the first part of the year. The decline aligns with Tryg's strategy of rebalancing the portfolio in order to reduce volatility. The fall in the top-line was visible in all countries as the segment rebalanced its exposures.\n",

In the comparison year, Tryg was impacted by a few large claims below the company's retention level. The run-off result was significantly lower at 7.9% (14.7%), whilst weather claims were lower at 1.1% (1.7%). The segment continued to display good underwriting discipline by implementing profitability initiatives across countries and maintaining a strong focus on rebalancing the portfolio, as evidenced by an improved underlying claims ratio.\n",
